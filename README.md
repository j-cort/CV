## Skills

### Analytical thinking

My ability to think analytically was the key to my success during my degree in Molecular Biology. I have found many striking parallels between designing scientific experiments, interpreting the results, and then iteratively improving that design, and the process of testing software, debugging it, and improving a program incrementally.

### Attention to detail

My time as an IT risk analyst at EY required deep focus and catching small details which could compromise the security of a system. This work also gave me high level exposure to the concepts of data security and IT controls. Keeping these concepts in mind motivates me to design software which meets user needs without compromising personal data or exposing the business to unnecessary risk.
  
### Delivering results under pressure

While working as a Recruitment Consultant at Robert Walters, delivering results under intense pressure was the norm. Learning to thrive under this pressure whilst retaining my personal values and professional standards was my greatest asset. Far from hard-selling and slick-talking, I found that forming relationships built on trust and integrity led to long-term compounding returns. I learned to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset and took responsibility for expanding my business and making my own opportunities. This experience taught me that true growth happens once you step outside of the comfort zone.

### Adaptability and continous learning

The prospect of continuous learning is what first attracted me to programming. Eager to extend my learning beyond the ruby/rails-focused technologies of my bootcamp, I have spent my evenings teaching myself additional technologies including JS/Node, React, MongoDB and Python. I particularly enjoy creating single page React apps and am looking forward to tackling NEXT.js and GraphQL as an extension of this. My self-study program has given me confidence that I can quickly pick-up the tech stack in any given team.
